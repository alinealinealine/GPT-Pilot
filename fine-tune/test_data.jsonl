framework change in gansu and ii knowledge sharing and capacity building to support the clients financial literacy training work with women borrowers in gansu financial additionality 42 financing structure prevailing domestic regulations limit an mccs borrowings to two to three times its shareholders equity and very few local lenders in the market are ready to provide longterm funding to mccs in china for cfpa mf 76 percent of its total funding including funding from local commercial banks development finance institutions and other types of funding providers such as peertopeer lending platforms and insurance companies is up to oneyear and the remaining 24 percent is for up to fiveyears obtaining longterm local currency is even more difficult 79 percent of cfpa mfs local currency funding is up to oneyear and only 21 percent of its local currency funding is for up to fiveyears which includes funding from ifc the asian development bank and a local insurance company thus cfpa mf has limited access to longterm funding particularly longterm local currency funding and cfpa mf is also nondeposit taking making it more important for the company to source additional longerterm local currency funding that will strengthen both its financial structure and its ability to withstand adverse conditions and provide much needed funding to its borrowers 43 resource mobilization while borrowings from international markets are allowed for mccs most international lenders cannot provide local currency or do not offer local currency funding at longer tenors other than selected development finance institutions as mentioned above this constrains local mccs access to commercial funding from international markets through the proposed investment ifc will provide its structured treasury solutions such as cross currency swaps to mobilize commercial funding from international lenders and offer local currency funding to cfpa mf this will also be the first syndicated loan cfpa mf receives nonfinancial additionality 22 including the central bank the banking regulator and provincial financial affairs offices or local financial supervision and administration bureaus 17 mccs business coverage to the whole province drawing comfort from its good track record the regulator allows cfpa mf to use the proceeds of the project for lending across the province as a test case the provincial regulator has also indicated that it will offer a positive opinion on approving a provincial lending license for cfpa mf following sound performance from cfpa mf while supported by this project ifcs participation in this project will accelerate the formalization of the provincewide operations of cfpa mf encourage cfpa mf to strengthen its focus and to put in more resources to better serve womenownedmanaged mvses in broader rural area in gansu create a best practice example for privatelyowned mccs in gansu and contribute to catalyzing the mcc regulatory framework in gansu as a whole 45 knowledge innovation and capacity building about 70 percent of cfpa mfs borrowers in gansu are women more than 90 percent of the borrowers are rural residents and have education at or below middle school level around 75 percent are first time borrowers of formal loans the low education level of many women in the rural areas of gansu has contributed to their low financial literacy and prohibited them from participating in economic activities in the formal economy the majority of mccs and banks in gansu are reluctant to provide financing to women entrepreneurs in rural areas due to perceived higher credit risk caused by weak financial discipline unstable income a lack of decisionmaking power over family or business matters or generally low education levels to familiarize its borrowers with concepts of timely repayment accumulating savings and better financial planning cfpa mf has mandatory basic financial literacy training before disbursement this represents the first financial education for a majority of cfpa mfs borrowers particularly for women borrowers by leveraging the gender finance experience accumulated globally and regionally ifc will provide advisory services to help cfpa mf enhance its capacity in designing and delivering more systematic and broader financial literacy training to women borrowers through digital channels cfpa mf will cover the costs of such advisory services cfpa mf has been a longterm ifc advisory client since 2007 but this will be the first ifc advisory service to cfpa mf and any mcc in china focusing on financial literacy training to women borrowers in previous advisory engagements ifc mainly focused on the commercial transformation of cfpa mf and enhancing the companys management and operation capacity through advisory programs in the areas of organizational structure credit management risk management and internal controls 18 summary 51 the project has an anticipated impact measurement and
