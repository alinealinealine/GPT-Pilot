('Vinci' or the 'Fund Manager'), a strong partner to CDF with differentiated strategy in the Brazilian mid-cap space. VCP IV is part of Vinci's flagship private equity strategy and is the successor fund to several similar strategies pursued by Vinci since 2003. The Fund will seek to make 8-12 investments in growth stage Brazilian companies, providing equity ticket sizes between US$70 million and US$90 million mostly control and control-oriented investments (50%- 80%) while opportunistically considering minority growth investments (30%- 50%) with strong control rights. VCP IV will be sector agnostic but will focus on industries where Vinci has developed expertise, namely: Healthcare, Consumer & Retail, Education, Financial Services, Technology, and Agribusiness. Within these sectors, Vinci will pursue investments across 5 key Brazil trends they identified: Digitalization, aging population, health & wellness, sustainability, and convenience seeking consumer base.                                                   \\nDevelopment Impact: \\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\"completion\":\" Vinci will support value creation for its portfolio in Brazil and commit to investing in at least 25 percent female led portfolio companies for the first time. The market creation claim is to strengthen the competitiveness of Brazil's PE market. This fund will build on Vinci III's early success and supports other recent IFC PE investments in Brazil's to continue to demonstrate the mid-market segment is attractive to institutional investors, reducing the segments reliance of DFIs.\\n##\\n\"}\n",
            "{\"prompt\":\"The he proposed IFC investment consists of the financing of a desalinization plant and water pipeline to provide 1,000 liters per second (l/s) of desalinated water to diverse users in the central V and Metropolitan regions of Chile (the 'Project'). A large portion of the water will be sold under contract to industrial-scale users, while the Project will also sell water to six rural potable water associations (APR, for its Spanish acronym). Aguas Pacífico Holding SpA, a portfolio company of Patria Infrastructure Fund III, an existing IFC client, will own and operate the Project. The Project costs are estimated at US$[822] million, to be financed with long-term debt and equity. The proposed IFC investment consists of up to US$[200] million A Loan and up to US$[459] million B Loan. The Project captures three major components: (1) The Aconcagua Desalination Plant in the bay of Quintero (the 'Desalination Plant'), comprised of a seawater intake submerged pipeline, a brine emissary submerged pipeline, a 1,000 l/s reverse osmosis desalination plant, a 110 kV transmission line connecting the desalination plant (1 km), and a 28 km buried water pipeline between the plant and San Isidro (near Quillota); (2) the San Isidro  Quilapilun Aqueduct (the 'Water Pipeline'), comprised of a pumping station, a 23 kV transmission line connected to the pumping station (5 km), and a 76 km buried water pipeline including a 6 km tunnel between San Isidro and Quilapilun), and distribution tanks in La Dormida, Til Til and Quilapilun, and (3) the Puchuncavi Substation (the 'Substation'), comprised of a 110/23 kV electrical substation at the Desalination Plant site.  The financing will consist of two packages: (i) senior secured loans of up to US$[268] million for the Desalination Plant and for the Substation ('Financing Package 1'), and (ii) senior secured loans of up to US$[390] million for the Water Pipeline ('Financing Package 2').                                                    \\nDevelopment Impact: \\n\\n###\\n\\n\",\"completion\":\" The Project's direct impact will be the sustainable supply of water for industrial use in a water-stressed region of Chile. The Valparaíso Region has suffered from a 13-year drought that has afflicted the country.\\nBeyond the direct impact, the Project will contribute to market creation as it will be Chile's first multi-use desalination plant. The Project has the potential to demonstrate the viability of this model, encouraging the\\ndevelopment of additional multi-user desalination plants that efficiently address the climate-induced water scarcity in Chile.\\n##\\n\"}\n"
